        "- The price is taken by the retailer companies and used to estimate household demand. Households' electricity demand is a function of their demand income. In addition, somehouseholds have distributed energy technologies and storage. Some households are poor and they only have flat tariffs. The others have to choose a retailer and make a contract for a year. After the household demand is estimated the retailers submit to the generation company, and the utility will estimate price again. And this goes until the unserved demand becomes zero.\n"
